# TicTacToe Game

Tic Tac Toe is a game played between 2 Players with moves 'X' and 'O'. It consist of a board with 9 squares and each player proceeds with the game by making moves with either 'X' or 'O'. The player completely occupying either of the row or column or any of the two diagonals with there moves wins the game.

## Rules

The rules are described below :

- X always goes first.
- Players cannot play on a played position.
- Players alternate placing X’s and O’s on the board until either:
	- One player has three in a row, horizontally, vertically or diagonally
	- All nine squares are filled.
- If a player is able to draw three X’s or three O’s in a row, that player wins.
- If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
